# Boltpay

Lightning Network payment links for freelancers and online sellers.
Generate a payment link, share it, get paid — withdrawals to bKash,
Nagad, or Binance with an admin-reviewed payout flow.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + Supabase JS v2 (no build step)
- **Backend:** Supabase — Postgres, Row Level Security, Edge Functions
- **Payments:** our own LND Lightning node (Lightning Network only)
- **Edge routing:** Cloudflare Worker — renders correct link-preview
  metadata for WhatsApp/Telegram/Facebook when a payment link is shared

## Repo layout

```
public/                          → static site root
  index.html                     → landing page + logged-in redirect
  login.html / register.html     → auth pages
  404.html                       → not-found page AND the payment page:
                                   any unmatched path is treated as a slug
  dashboard.html                 → creator dashboard

  theme.js                       → per-domain LAYOUT switching (not colour —
                                   the brand palette is the same everywhere)

```

## Setup

Follow `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` top to bottom — it is ordered so each step's
dependencies are in place by the time you reach it.

## How the money model works

There is exactly one definition of a creator's withdrawable balance, and it
lives in SQL:

```
available = sum(settled payments) − sum(withdrawals that are not rejected)
```

`get_balance_for()` computes it. `get_my_balance()` is the creator-facing
wrapper the dashboard calls. `request_withdrawal()` and
`system_queue_withdrawal()` both check against it while holding a lock on the
creator's profile row, which serialises concurrent requests.

Nothing else may write to `withdrawals` — there is no client INSERT policy on
that table, so a browser cannot mint a request that skips the balance check.
Status transitions to `paid`/`processing`/`rejected` go through
`system_claim_withdrawal()`, which is atomic and only fires once.

If you change any of this, change it in one place. Two functions with two
slightly different balance formulas is how the same money gets paid out twice.

## Security notes worth knowing before you deploy

- Migration **0018** is not optional. Before it, any signed-in creator could
  run `update profiles set role = 'admin'` on their own row, insert
  withdrawals directly, and read every payment in the system.
- Migration **0033** is not optional either. It adds the `webhook_events`
  table (historical delivery log) and CHECK
  constraints that make negative or zero amounts unwritable no matter which
  code path tries.
- The `/process-withdrawal` and `/admin-mark-settled` routes use the service
  role key internally, which bypasses RLS entirely — so the admin check has to
  live in code, not the database. It does, in `verifyAdminCaller()`.
- Creator display names and withdrawal destinations are free text that lands in
  the admin panel. Escape anything you add to that page.
- `payments.method` is constrained to `'lightning'` only at the database
  level — USDC support was intentionally removed.
- Run the regression queries in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` §6 after any migration.
- Security headers (CSP, `frame-ancestors 'none'` for clickjacking, nosniff,
  etc.) live in `public/_headers` and are applied automatically by the
  Cloudflare static-assets deploy. Admin-facing edge functions restrict
  browser origins against the `site_domains` registry — the same list the
  admin panel manages, so adding a domain there enables CORS within ~5
  minutes, no secret or redeploy needed. Payment failures push a `🚨` alert
  to the `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` secret (Discord / Slack / Telegram-bot
  webhook). See `docs/ENV_VARS.md`.

See `SECURITY.md` for the full trust-boundary write-up.


## Scheduled jobs

All of them run through `pg_cron` + `pg_net`, reading their secrets from Vault.

| Job | When (UTC) | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `boltpay-health` | every 15 min | lnd-watcher settling invoices, cron alive, withdrawals not stuck. Alerts on failure. |
| `prune-webhook-events` | 03:20 | 90-day retention on `webhook_events` |
| `ledger-backup-trigger` | 11:05 | Full ledger snapshot committed to the ledger repo |
| `daily-report-trigger` | 18:10 | Writes the `daily_stats` archive |

Check what is scheduled:

```sql
select jobname, schedule, active from cron.job order by jobname;
```

## What "a day" means here

Every daily figure in this system runs **5:00 PM to 5:00 PM Asia/Dhaka**,
not midnight to midnight, and a cycle is named after the date it *started*.

One SQL function defines it — `daily_totals_for_cycle()` — and everything
else derives from that: `admin_daily_settled()`, `staff_daily_settled()`,
`my_daily_settled()`, and the `daily-report` cron. They cannot drift apart
because there is only one definition.

## Alerting

Set either or both, in Supabase → Edge Functions → Secrets:

```
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL            Discord or Slack incoming webhook
ALERT_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN     Telegram bot token
ALERT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID       Telegram chat to post into
```

`health` uses these. With neither set they log a
warning and carry on — nothing breaks, but nobody is told.

## Checking things by hand

```bash
# Is everything alive? (?alert=0 keeps it out of the alert channel)
curl -H "x-cron-secret: $CRON_SECRET" \
  "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/health?alert=0"

# Force a ledger snapshot and verify it is complete
curl -H "x-cron-secret: $CRON_SECRET" \
  "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/ledger-backup"

# Rebuild the daily archive
curl -H "x-cron-secret: $CRON_SECRET" \
  "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/daily-report?days=30"
```

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs on every push:

| Job | Blocking | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| Migrations | no | Every migration applies in order to an empty Postgres; migration numbers are unique |
| Edge functions | yes | `deno check` on every function — a real type-check, unlike a bundler |
| Pages | yes | Inline JS parses; every element id and on-handler exists; every `rpc()` call matches its SQL definition |
| Ledger snapshots | no | Reports whether ledger snapshots are tracked in this repo |

The two non-blocking jobs report without failing the build: one is
environment-sensitive, the other reflects a deliberate choice while this
repository stays private.

## Auditing

`audit_log` records who changed a fee, a role, a moderator assignment or a
creator's instant-payout access — with the old value alongside the new
one. It is append-only: there is no update or delete policy for anyone,
including admins.

```sql
select occurred_at, actor_email, action, old_value, new_value
from audit_log order by occurred_at desc limit 50;
```


## Before a migration reaches production

`docs/STAGING.md` covers setting up a second Supabase project to apply
migrations against first. CI proves a migration applies to an *empty*
database; staging is where you find out what it does to one with rows in
it.

## What is deliberately not built

Some things were considered and left out, with reasons, so they are not
rediscovered as oversights:

**Payments archival and a materialised view for the daily rollups.**
At a few thousand payments these solve nothing. Postgres orders and
aggregates this volume without effort, especially with the indexes added
in 0044, and both would add a moving part that can fall out of sync with
the table it summarises. Worth revisiting if the payment count reaches
the low millions or the Earnings tab starts feeling slow — not before.

**Client-side login rate limiting.** It would be theatre. Anything
enforced in the browser is bypassed by calling the API directly.
Supabase enforces auth rate limits server-side; configure them under
Authentication → Rate Limits rather than writing code that only stops
someone using the form.

**Hard deletion of support messages.** Removed on purpose in 0049. A
support thread is often the only record of what was agreed about
someone's money, so each side can hide a message from their own view and
neither can remove it from the other's.
