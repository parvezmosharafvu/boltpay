# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email the maintainer directly rather than opening a public issue. Include
enough detail to reproduce (endpoint, payload, expected vs. actual). Expect an
acknowledgement within a few days.

Please do not test against the production instance with real payments. Use a
testnet Lightning node.

## What is and is not a secret in this repo

Safe to commit — these are public by design:

- `public/config.js` — the Supabase project URL and **anon** key. The anon key
  identifies the project; it grants nothing on its own. Every real permission
  boundary is a Row Level Security policy or a `SECURITY DEFINER` function in
  `supabase/migrations/`.
- The same two values inlined at the top of `worker/og-preview-worker.js`.

Never commit:

- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — bypasses RLS completely.
- LND macaroons and TLS material (kept in Supabase Vault).
- `CRON_SECRET`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

All of the above belong in Supabase Edge Function secrets. See `docs/ENV_VARS.md`.

## Trust boundaries worth knowing before you deploy

- **The browser is not a boundary.** Anything the dashboard or admin panel can
  do, a user can do by hand against PostgREST with the anon key. Every rule
  that matters is enforced in SQL: `request_withdrawal()` owns the balance
  check, `guard_profile_updates()` owns which profile columns a creator may
  change, `enforce_link_limit()` and `validate_link_slug()` own link creation.
- **The service role bypasses RLS entirely.** The `/process-withdrawal` and
  `/admin-mark-settled` routes therefore verify the caller's admin role in
  code, via `verifyAdminCaller()`, before doing anything.
- **Withdrawal state transitions are claimed atomically.** Moving a withdrawal
  to `paid`, `processing` or `rejected` goes through
  `system_claim_withdrawal()`, which only succeeds from `pending`/`approved`.
  This is what stops a double-click from sending two real Lightning payouts.
- **`payments` is readable by anon only inside the payment window** so the
  public invoice page can receive Realtime updates. Rows older than two hours
  are invisible, and the column grant hides `user_id` and internal ids.
- **Creator-supplied text reaches the admin panel.** Display names and
  withdrawal destinations are attacker-controlled; the admin panel escapes
  every one of them before rendering. If you add a new field to that panel,
  escape it.
- **Settlement is idempotent.** An LND invoice is settled by its payment
  hash exactly once; repeated watcher or status checks are no-ops.
  Amounts additionally cannot be negative (or zero when requested) at the
  database level — CHECK constraints, not just application code.
- **Browser origins are restricted on the money endpoints.** `user-withdraw`
  and `admin-actions` only emit CORS headers for
  domains registered (and active) in `site_domains` — the admin panel's own
  domain registry, cached for 5 minutes in the function. An optional
  `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` secret can add hosts that should stay out of that
  registry. Payer endpoints are served same-origin through the Worker. `public/_headers` adds CSP and `frame-ancestors 'none'`
  (anti-clickjacking) to every page.

## After cloning or forking

Rotate every secret. The repository history contains a `CRON_SECRET` that was
committed in `ledger-backup-trigger.sql`, and the `ledger-backups/*.json`
snapshots contain real customer email addresses from the original deployment.
Treat both as public.

**Update (Aug 2026):** the `ledger-backups/` snapshots have been removed from
the working tree and the path is now in `.gitignore`. The nightly backup still
runs — it commits straight to the private GitHub repo configured via
`GITHUB_OWNER`/`GITHUB_REPO`, never into this one. If your fork's Git history
still contains either the snapshots or the old CRON_SECRET, purge the history
(`git filter-repo`) and rotate the secret per `docs/ENV_VARS.md` — deleting
the files from the latest commit does NOT remove them from history.
